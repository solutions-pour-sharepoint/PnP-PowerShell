* Added additional functionality for connect-sponline in resolving credentials. If no credentials are specified throught the -Credentials parameter, a query is done against the Windows Credentials Manager to retrieve credentials. First is checked for the full URL of the connect request, e.g. https://yourserver/sites/yoursite. If no credential is found for that entry, a query is done for https://yourserver/sites. If no credential is found that entry, a query is done for https://yourserver, if no credential is found for that entry a query is done for 'yourserver'. So:
```
Connect-SPOnline -Url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite
``` 
will mean that it will check your credential manager for entries in this order:

```
https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite
https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites
https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com
yourtenant.sharepoint.com
```

Notice that using
```
Connect-SPOnline -Url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite -Credentials <yourlabel>
```
still works as before.
