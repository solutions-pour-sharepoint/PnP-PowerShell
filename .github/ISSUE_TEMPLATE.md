###Notice: many issues / bugs reported are actually related to the PnP Core Library which is used behind the scenes. Consider carefully where to report an issue:###

1. **Are you using ```Apply-SPOProvisioningTemplate``` or ```Get-SPOProvisioningTemplate```**? The issue is most likely related to the Provisioning Engine. The Provisioning engine is _not_ located in the PowerShell repo. Please report the issue here: https://github.com/officedev/PnP-Sites-Core/issues.
2. **Is the issue related to the cmdlet itself, its parameters, the syntax, or do you suspect it is the code of the cmdlet that is causing the issue?** Then please continue reporting the issue in this repo.
3. **If you think that the functionality might be related to the underlying libraries that the cmdlet is calling** (We realize that that might be difficult to determine), please first double check the code of the cmdlet, which can be found here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Commands. If related to the cmdlet, continue reporting the issue here, otherwise report the issue at https://github.com/officedev/PnP-Sites-Core/issues
