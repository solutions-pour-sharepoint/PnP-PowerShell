# Commands included #
[Navigate here for an overview of all cmdlets and their parameters](Documentation/readme.md)

# Installation #

There are 2 ways to install the cmdlets. We recommend, where possible, to install them from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). Check out the "Getting Started with the Gallery" section to make sure you have all requirements in place. Alternatively you can download the setup files and install the cmdlets directly.

## PowerShell Gallery ##

If you main OS is Windows 10, or if you have [PowerShellGet](https://github.com/powershell/powershellget) installed, you can run the following commands to install the PowerShell cmdlets:

|**SharePoint Version**|**Command to install**|
|------------------|------------------|
|SharePoint Online|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline ```|
|SharePoint 2016|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2016```|
|SharePoint 2013|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2013```|

*Notice*: if you install the latest PowerShellGet from Github, you might receive an error message stating 
>PackageManagement\Install-Package : The version 'x.x.x.x' of the module 'SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline' being installed is not catalog signed.

In order to install the cmdlets when you get this error specify the -SkipPublisherCheck switch with the Install-Module cmdlet, e.g. ```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline -SkipPublisherCheck -AllowClobber```

## Setup files ##
You can download the setup files from the [releases](https://github.com/officedev/pnp-powershell/releases) section of the PnP PowerShell repository. These files will up be updated on a monthly basis. Run the install and restart any open instances of PowerShell to use the cmdlets.

# Updating #
Every month a new release will be made available of the PnP PowerShell Cmdlets. If you earlier installed the cmdlets using the setup file, simply download the [latest version](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/releases/latest) and run the setup. This will update your existing installation.

If you have installed the cmdlets using PowerShellGet with ```Install-Module``` from the PowerShell Gallery then you will be able to use the following command to install the latest updated version:

```powershell
Update-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell*
``` 

This will automatically load the module after starting PowerShell 3.0.

You can check the installed PnP-PowerShell versions with the following command:

```powershell
Get-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell* -ListAvailable | Select-Object Name,Version | Sort-Object Version -Descending
```

# Getting started #

To use the library you first need to connect to your tenant:

```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline –Url https://yoursite.sharepoint.com –Credentials (Get-Credential)
```

To view all cmdlets, enter:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module *PnP*
```

At the following links you will find a few videos on how to get started with the cmdlets:

## Setting up credentials ##
See this [wiki page](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/wiki/How-to-use-the-Windows-Credential-Manager-to-ease-authentication-with-PnP-PowerShell) for more information on how to use the Windows Credential Manager to setup credentials that you can use in unattended scripts.

## Building the source code ##

If you have set up up the projects and you are ready to build the source code, make sure to build the SharePointPnP.PowerShellModuleFilesGenerator project first. This project will be executed after every build and it will generate the required PSD1 and XML files with cmdlet documentation in them.

When you build the solution a postbuild script will copy the required files to a folder in your users folder called 
*C:\Users\\\<YourUserName\>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SharePointPnPPowerShell\<Platform\>*. During build also the help and document files will be generated. If you have a session of PowerShell open in which you have used the PnP Cmdlets, make sure to close this PowerShell session first before you build. You will receive a build error otherwise because it tries to overwrite files that are in use.

To debug the cmdlets: launch PowerShell and attach Visual Studio to the powershell.exe process. In case you want to debug methods in PnP Sites Core, make sure that you open the PnP Sites Core project instead, and then attach Visual Studio to the powershell.exe. In case you see strange debug behavior, like it wants to debug PSReadLine.ps1, uninstall the PowerShell extension from Visual Studio.
